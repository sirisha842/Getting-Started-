SQL Comments are used to explain the sections of the SQL statements, and used to prevent the statements of SQL. 
In many programming languages, comments matter a lot.
There are three types of comments, which are given below:

Single line comments.
Multi-line comments
Inline comments

Single Line Comment
Comments starting and ending with a single line are said as individual line comments. 
The line which starts with 'â€“' is a single line comment, and that particular line is not executed.
The text between -- and end of the line is ignored and cannot be executed.

Multi-line Comments
Comments that start in one line and end in different front are said as multi-line comments. The text between /* and */ is ignored in the code part.
The line starting with '/*' is considered as a starting point of comment and terminated when '*/' lies at the end.

Inline comments:
Inline comments are an extension of multi-line comments, and comments can be stated between the statements and are enclosed in between '/*' and '*/.'
